# CourseSearch
 [Available on Playstore ](https://www.play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.feranmideveloper.coursesearch)
 
CourseSearch is an Android app that helps to find, search and explore courses instead of going to the Udemy website. It utilizes the Udemy REST API. Also provides offline storage to review courses offline before purchase. 

This app was built as my final project during the Google Africa Developer Training Program in Android Development. [Here's my certificate](https://www.adscerts.com/scholar/7699E5FDFB198DB)


üèÜThis app was also voted 4th best out of 150 reviewed projects in Africa during the program.
